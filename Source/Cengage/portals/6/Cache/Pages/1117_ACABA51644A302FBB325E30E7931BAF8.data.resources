Unfortunately, it turns out that there are some legal restrictions when it comes to passing out time machines. Let me tell you, they were awfully angry about the results of our first few sales, though personally I have no problems with our new Dinosaur Overlords.</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short, we’re not going to be able to continue production on our new Paradox™ line. In fact, we’re going to have to ask everybody who has purchased one of these bicycles to return them. Don’t worry though, we’ll be providing you with full refunds. If you have any questions, about this recall, please feel free to give us a call.</p>
