3. INSTRUCTION TO RIGHT TO REVOCATION

3.1 RIGHT TO REVOCATION: As a consumer, you will have a legal "cooling off period" during which you may revoke your order for any reason without statements of reasons. This period is up to two weeks and commences not earlier than the delivery of this instruction. In case of delivery of a physical product this period starts with delivery of the product. The right to revocation will be treated as exercised on the date of posting the notice of revocation or the date of dispatching the returned product. All revocation notices must be in textform (e.g. mail, e-mail) and have to be addressed to mediaANT@email.de

3.2 PLEASE NOTE: YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO REVOCATION
3.2.1 Where you order audio records or video records or software, where you have unsealed the software.  
3.2.2 Where you order bespoke or customised products made specifically to your order or your needs or can not be returned because of their nature, e.g. download products. 

3.3 LEGAL CONSEQUENCE: If you exercise the above right to revocation, you are required to return the relevant products to us including fruits thereof and we are required to reimburse your prepayments including fruits thereof (e.g. interests). If you are not able to return the products or if the products are defective, you are required to pay compensation. This does not apply to products, which deterioration is due solely to the inspection of the products - like you would do it in shops. You may prevent yourself from having to pay compensation for damaged products, if you do not make use of the products in your possesion and if you take reasonable care of the products in your possesion. You have to bear the costs of returning the products, unless your order has a value of more than 40 EUR. In case your order has a value of more than 40 EUR, we will only bear the costs of returning the products, if you had already made payment or part contractual part payments by the time of revocation. Where wrong products have been delivered to you, we will bear the costs of returning the products regardless of the value of your order. Any compensation payments for damaged products have to be made by you within 30 days after you have given your declaration of revocation.
The product must be returned to the return address stated on the delivery note that was accompanied with the product.

3.4 PLEASE NOTE: such right to revocation, where you order services, terminates if those services commence with your agreement before the cooling off period expires (e.g. download of products). 
If you require more information on your rights, you should contact customer support.
