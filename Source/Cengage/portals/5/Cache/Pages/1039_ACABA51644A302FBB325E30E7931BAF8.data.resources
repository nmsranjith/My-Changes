<p>We’re proud to announce the launch of our new Paradox™ line of Time-Traveling Bicycles. That’s right, you too can explore the mysteries of the past or view wonders of the future just by hopping on one of our bicycles!</p>
<p>I’m sure you’re wondering how we came up with Time Travel. Well, our lead engineer was trying to figure out how to make our electric bikes require even less physical exertion, and he stumbled upon a happy accident. It turns out that, after a few modifications, taking one of our electric models over a speed of 88 miles an hour allows you to bypass the laws of the physics. Awesome!</p>
